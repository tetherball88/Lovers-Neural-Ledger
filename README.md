# 🔮 Lover's Neural Ledger Integration 🔥

## Overview

This integration mod creates a powerful bridge between **SkyrimNet** AI framework and **Lover's Ledger** OStim's statistics mod for Skyrim, adding sexual history to NPC's biography context. 🗣️💬

## 📋 Requirements

- [SkyrimNet](https://github.com/MinLL/SkyrimNet-GamePlugin/tree/main) - Core LLM framework
- [Lover's Ledger](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/158983) - For enhanced relationship statistics

## 🔧 How It Works

Whenever you use talk to NCP via SkyrimNet small portion of data will be added to NPC's biography block. It will add 2 parts to context:
- npc's sexual behavior(telling SkyrimNet NPC's preferences in gender and solo/exlusive/group settings)
- npc's lovers history(list of sex relationships with other NPCs)
